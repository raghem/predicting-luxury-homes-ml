# Predicting Luxury Homes Using Machine Learning

## Business Problem
Accurately identifying luxury homes is valuable for real estate pricing,
market segmentation, and investment analysis. This project predicts whether
a home is classified as luxury based on key property features.

## Objective
Build and evaluate machine learning models that classify homes as luxury or
non-luxury using real housing data.

## Data
The dataset includes numerical housing features such as:
- Square Footage
- Number of Bedrooms
- Price-derived luxury classification (target)

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Train-test split
4. Model training and evaluation

## Models Trained
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Model Performance
## Model Performance
The final model achieved the following results on the test dataset:
- **MAE:** 0.1068  
- **RMSE:** 0.3268  
- **R²:** 0.5729  

These results indicate the model explains approximately 57% of the variance
in luxury home classification, providing a strong baseline for predictive
real estate analytics.
