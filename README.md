# Predicting Luxury Homes Using Machine Learning

## Business Problem
Accurately identifying luxury homes is valuable for real estate pricing,
market segmentation, and investment analysis. This project predicts whether
a home is classified as luxury based on key property features.

## Objective
Build and evaluate machine learning models that classify homes as luxury or
non-luxury using real housing data.

## Data
The dataset includes numerical housing features such as:
- Square Footage
- Number of Bedrooms
- Price-derived luxury classification (target)

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Train-test split
4. Model training and evaluation

## Models Trained
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Model Performance
Final model evaluation metrics:
- **MAE:** (see results/metrics.txt)
- **RMSE:** (see results/metrics.txt)
- **R²:** (see results/metrics.txt)

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Repository Structure
